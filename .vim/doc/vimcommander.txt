4. VimCommander Keys                                       *vimcommander-keys*

    Most of VimCommander's key-bindings are similar to the other
    commanders':

    - TAB       = Go to the other panel.
    - F3        = View file under cursor.
    - F4        = Edit file under cursor.
    - F5        = Copy file.
    - F6        = Move/rename file.
    - F7        = Create directory.
    - F8/DEL    = Remove file.
    - F10       = Quit VimCommander.
    - C-R       = Refresh panels.
	- Backspace = Go to parent directory.
    - C-U       = Exchange panels.
    - C-Left    = Put directory under cursor on other panel, or grab
                  other panel's dir.
    - C-Right   = Same.
    - \H        = Show hidden files (toggle).
    - INS       = Select file under cursor.
    - "+"       = Select file by pattern.
    - "-"       = De-select file by pattern.
    - S-F4      = Edit new file.
    - C-t       = Previous directory.
    - C-y       = Next directory.

    C-* stands for CTRL+*. S-* stands for SHIFT+*.
    As some terminals do not support SHIFT/CTRL+non-letter-keys, a <leader>
    version has usually been provided.
    So, <leader>Right and C-Right are the same.
    Same for M-keys, including letters.
